# RIP FRC TEAM :(

### PRIVATE SCHOOL DOESNT WANT TO FUND LAST STEAM PROGRAM LEFT AFTER KILLING THE STEAM PROFILE



## ~~Introduction~~

~~Villaciraptors 9076, a First Robotics team based in Montreal, QC, embarked on its rookie journey just last year. We started with just a handful of motivated students and mentors. Since then, we learned a lot from our experiences and challenges. We are now a team with about 40 dedicated members from grades 7 to 11. Each year, our team participates in the FIRST robotics competition, a world-wide competition for high school students.~~

## ~~Team Mission and Values~~

~~We're dedicated to making robotics accessible to all, regardless of engineering skills. Our inclusive, safe and supportive environment encourages teamwork, respect, and lifelong skills. These values extend beyond robotics, shaping culture where every member feels valued and heard. As a new club, we welcome members with any level of experience, ensuring everyone contributes to our robot's creative process.~~

### ~~Core Values:~~

~~- **Innovation:** We foster creativity and innovation by encouraging team members to explore new ideas and approaches to solving problems.~~
~~- **Collaboration:** We value teamwork and collaboration, recognizing that diverse perspectives and skills are essential for success.~~
